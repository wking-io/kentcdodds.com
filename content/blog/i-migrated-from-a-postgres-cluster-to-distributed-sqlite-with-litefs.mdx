Over the last few weeks, I've been heads-down on building the content for
[EpicWeb.dev](https://epicweb.dev). And I've been building it all in the open on
[my YouTube channel](https://kcd.im/YouTube). If you've been watching
[my EpicWeb.dev live streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV5CVI1eNcJhNHoK946zgZ8ZivZbo6uyx),
you'll know that I've been building the app we'll use to learn web dev: Rocket
Rental ðŸš€. With that app, I've started with SQLite and I've been trying to
decide whether I should move over to Postgres.

When
[I released the 2021 update to kentcdodds.com](/blog/how-i-built-a-modern-website-in-2021),
I decided to use Postgres on [Fly.io](https://fly.io) because of its support for
multi-regional deploys and both Postgres and Redis clusters with automatic data
replication (I use Redis for caching slow/rate limited third party APIs and
expensive computations). That proved to work out really well. My site is fast
wherever you are in the world. However, there are a few downsides:

1. Databases are way outside my wheelhouse (and personal interest).
2. Running my app locally requires starting up Postgres/Redis via
   `docker compose` which is fine, but annoying, especially for contributors.
3. The infrastructure is complicated and can fail occasionally.

Also, when I built and deployed my site, I think I was the first to build and
deploy a distributed Node.js app with a Postgres cluster on the Fly.io network.
I believe the infra has improved, but I was still running on older versions of
things and reliability was a problem (for both Postgres and Redis). I could
definitely upgrade and improve those reliability concerns, but I had another
idea. My site gets enough regular traffic that these reliability issues led to
me getting a lot of tweets like this:

https://twitter.com/TheRyanFurrer/status/1582905750590222337

So I've been wanting to address these issues, but because I'm heads-down on
EpicWeb, I didn't know how I could justify spending time on my personal site.

Whelp, I started the "Rocket Rental" app with SQLite to keep things simple and
I'd really like to keep that if possible. At the same time, it's important to me
that the app I use to teach web development is realistic. So I was expecting
that eventually I'd move to "a real database" like Postgres. But I've been
hearing rumblings about SQLite being pretty dang capable, so I decided to take
advantage of my personal site's database reliability issues to spend time
investigating SQLite's feasibility for use in my site.

## [Litestream](https://litestream.io/)

Several months ago, I met [Kurt](https://twitter.com/mrkurt) (Fly.io CEO) at
[Remix Conf](https://remix.run/conf). We talked about a new project he's been
very excited about that I'd heard rumblings about called
[Litestream](https://litestream.io/). He suggested that for many categories of
applications, SQLite can provide an even better user experience than Postgres
along with a simplified developer experience. Whenever I hear "better UX _and_
DX," I'm interested.

Litestream was
[originally created](https://litestream.io/blog/why-i-built-litestream/) to
improve reliability of SQLite in edge cases (specifically, disaster recovery),
but the way this was done also lends itself well to the idea of distributed
SQLite deployments.

Turns out by the time Kurt and I had our conversation, he'd already hired
[Ben Johnson](https://twitter.com/benbjohnson) (the author of Litestream) to
work at Fly. Ben wrote
[an awesome article](https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/)
explaining what Litestream is. I recommend you give it a read if you're
unconvinced that SQLite is production-ready. He'll convince you it is.

## LiteFS

Litestream has had "read-replicas" as a desired future feature for over a year.
Ben joined Fly to work on that and has now released
[LiteFS](https://fly.io/blog/introducing-litefs). Architecturally, LiteFS works
similarly to Postgres clusters. One LiteFS node is the "primary" and other nodes
automatically replicate data writes. LiteFS acts as a proxy to your SQLite
database (you connect to LiteFS instead of the underlying database) and then
LiteFS effectively replays data updates to all read replicas. And this reply
happens behind the scenes normally within 200ms (on par with distributed
Postgres clusters).

LiteFS allows us to get distributed SQLite. As a reminder, the benefit of
distributed databases is that the data for your app can be geographically close
to the users of your app leading to hundreds of milliseconds performance boost
for many users.

Additionally, SQLite data access is much faster than Postgres which is "fast
enough" normally, but actually means
[SQLite suffers much less from N+1 queries](https://www.sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html)
(which should be avoided, but this is nice).

So with LiteFS, our users get a faster app because we get faster data access
that's distributed all over the world. And on top of that, it's simpler thanks
to the fact we don't have to manage a database server.

## Evaluating the existing data

So, with that, I realized that it's possible for me to migrate to SQLite on my
site without giving up the distributed nature of my app. Luckily for me, LiteFS
is still in beta at Fly, so the migration went off without a hitch of course (jk
jk, I felt the beta nature of things pretty hard ðŸ˜…).

My existing app has the following Postgres data model:

```
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("POSTGRES_DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

enum Role {
  ADMIN
  MEMBER
}

enum Team {
  BLUE
  RED
  YELLOW
}

model User {
  id           String     @id @default(uuid())
  createdAt    DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime   @updatedAt
  email        String     @unique(map: "User.email_unique")
  firstName    String
  discordId    String?
  convertKitId String?
  role         Role       @default(MEMBER)
  team         Team
  calls        Call[]
  sessions     Session[]
  postReads    PostRead[]
}

model Session {
  id             String   @id @default(uuid())
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
  user           User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  userId         String
  expirationDate DateTime
}

model Call {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  title       String
  description String
  keywords    String
  user        User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  userId      String
  base64      String
}

model PostRead {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  user      User?    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  userId    String?
  clientId  String?
  postSlug  String
}
```

By far, the largest table in my database is the `PostRead` table with nearly a
half million rows. This actually blows my mind because that [measures](/teams)
_actual_ reads of my blog posts, not just page loads. Anyway, there are several
thousand user and session rows and very few call rows (though those hold a lot
of data).

The amount of data is important because the first thing I needed to think about
was how to migrate the data. There are various established practices for doing
this. I'm not a database guy, so I'm not well versed in them, but I considered
one approach: Run both databases at the same time and write to both of them,
writes go to both while still reading from the old one, then switch to reading
from the new one and take down the old one... That sounded... annoyingly
difficult. And unnecessary for my situation. But I did explore it for a while.
It's probably what you'd want to do to ensure you had absolutely 0 data loss in
the time it takes to move users to the new version of the app.

In my case, I was ok with a tiny bit of data loss. All that would be lost would
be the data collected and changed in the Postgres database after I copied
everything over to SQLite. I planned on doing the switch over as a DNS switch
immediately after copying over the database so hopefully that would be a pretty
short time.

We'll talk more about how I actually migrated the data itself later.

## Updating App code

With that established, I needed to migrate my application from Postgres to
SQLite. Luckily, because I use Prisma, this was pretty simple! Here's the diff
to the schema file:

```diff add=3,29,31 remove=2,9-19,28,30
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

...

enum Role {
  ADMIN
  MEMBER
}

enum Team {
  BLUE
  RED
  YELLOW
}

model User {
  id           String     @id @default(uuid())
  createdAt    DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime   @updatedAt
  email        String     @unique(map: "User.email_unique")
  firstName    String
  discordId    String?
  convertKitId String?
  role         Role       @default(MEMBER)
  team         Team
  role         String     @default("MEMBER")
  team         String
  calls        Call[]
  sessions     Session[]
  postReads    PostRead[]
}

...
```

I had to turn enum types into strings due to SQLite's lack of support for enums.
Other than that, all I had to do was switch from `postgresql` to `sqlite` in the
`provider` and everything else just worked for the schema.

Of course, this impacted my application a bit due to my reliance on those enums.
I know prisma is working on a feature called "extensions" that would probably
allow me to hook into prisma to do runtime checks to turn those columns into
enums (effectively) so I wouldn't have to update any app code, but I'd rather
not use that experimental feature just yet. So instead, I wrote a few handy
types and utility functions:

```ts
type Team = 'RED' | 'BLUE' | 'YELLOW'
type Role = 'ADMIN' | 'MEMBER'
type OptionalTeam = Team | 'UNKNOWN'

const teams: Array<Team> = ['RED', 'BLUE', 'YELLOW']
const roles: Array<Role> = ['ADMIN', 'MEMBER']
const isTeam = (team?: string): team is Team => teams.includes(team as Team)
const isRole = (role?: string): role is Role => roles.includes(role as Role)
const getTeam = (team?: string): Team | null => (isTeam(team) ? team : null)
const getOptionalTeam = (team?: string): OptionalTeam =>
  isTeam(team) ? team : 'UNKNOWN'
```

With that, I just followed TypeScript squiggly lines to fix a few places that
were busted (huzzah for TypeScript).

### Database connections

The next thing that added complexity to my setup is updating how the database
connects. To understand why this is so complicated, you need to understand a bit
of the constraints I had with multi-region databases.

In my Postgres app, my primary region was Dallas (`dfw`). Let's say you're in
Amsterdam (`ams`) and you want to update your first name in your KCD profile.
When that `POST` request comes in, I automatically send a special kind of
response with a header: `fly-replay: dfw`. Fly will intercept that response
before sending it to you and "replay" that request to the node app running in
Dallas.

It does this because the read replicas in all regions other than the primary
region are unable to accept write requests.

Doing this is simple enough because I'm using express so I just have a simple
middleware to do this for me. Unfortunately I do need to make data writes on
non-POST requests. For example, I like to update your `SESSION` if you make a
request within 6 weeks of your session's expiration so you don't have to
reauthenticate if you're a regular reader of the post. In that case, I have two
options:

1. Write to the primary region directly (even though you're not in the primary
   region)
2. Send a `fly-replay` response so it can be handled by the primary region

At the time I was working on my site originally, option 2 was very difficult. So
I went with option 1. So every region created two Prisma clients: One called
`prismaRead` (which connected to the local region db) and the other called
`prismaWrite` (which connected to the primary region db). This worked just fine.

Unfortunately, with this migration to SQLite, option 1 is no longer viable.
SQLite literally only runs locally on the machine and can't be connected to from
the outside world. So now I have new options:

1. Create special endpoints in my application so `ams` can call `dfw` to perform
   these specific writes.
2. Send a `fly-replay` response so it can be handled by the primary region

I started with option 1 and I almost finished with it. It wasn't really complex
or anything, but it sure was annoying. Then I remembered that when I was writing
my site originally, we didn't have the `throw Response` feature in Remix. In
Remix, at any point in your `action` or `loader`, you can throw a Response
object and Remix will catch that and send the response. This made option 2
_much_ easier. Had we been able to do this before, I would have gone with this
option originally!

So I simply created this function:

{/* TODO: update this once we figure out the right way to determine the primary */}

```ts
function ensurePrimary() {
  const FLY_REGION = getRequiredServerEnvVar('FLY_REGION')
  if (FLY_REGION !== ENV.PRIMARY_REGION) {
    throw getFlyReplayResponse()
  }
}

function getFlyReplayResponse() {
  return new Response('Fly Replay', {
    status: 409,
    headers: {'fly-replay': `region=${ENV.PRIMARY_REGION}`},
  })
}
```

With that, I could simply add `ensurePrimary()` in the few situations I needed
to do a write on a GET request:

```ts lines=4
// if there's less than ~six months left, extend the session
const twoWeeks = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 * 6
if (Date.now() + twoWeeks > session.expirationDate.getTime()) {
  ensurePrimary()
  const newExpirationDate = new Date(Date.now() + sessionExpirationTime)
  await prisma.session.update({
    data: {expirationDate: newExpirationDate},
    where: {id: sessionId},
  })
}
```

There really aren't many situations where a mutation on a GET makes sense so
this works great.

With that in place, I was able to remove all the `prismaWrite` and `prismaRead`
and just have a single `prisma` client. Ultimately this simplified things for me
quite a bit.

**To take things further,** the fly team is currently working on making it so
LiteFS will handle this all for me. They'll effectively allow writes to
non-primary DBs. So hopefully in the near-ish future I can remove all this from
my codebase. This will be a significant improvement.

### Redis

Another thing I've been wanting to do is get rid of Redis. Remix uses SQLite to
cache it's documentation pages and I realized I could do the same thing with my
blog posts and third party APIs I cached. This would significantly simplify my
architecture further by reducing the number of services my app depends on (Redis
had definitely caused outages on my site as well).

When I built my site, I created an abstraction for turning a function into a
"cachified" version of itself called... wait for it... `cachified`.
[Hannes Diercks](https://github.com/Xiphe) asked whether he could extract my
code for that and package it up as a library. I said yes and
[here it is](https://github.com/Xiphe/cachified). So I decided to take this
opportunity to delete my own implementation and use Hannes' improved library.

For the most part, this went very well. There were just a few different (better)
option names and I needed to write a SQLite adapter:

```ts
export const cache: Cache = {
  name: 'SQLite cache',
  async get(key) {
    const result = await prisma.cache.findUnique({
      where: {key},
      select: {value: true, metadata: true},
    })
    if (!result) return null
    return {
      metadata: JSON.parse(result.metadata),
      value: JSON.parse(result.value),
    }
  },
  async set(key, {value, metadata}) {
    const data = {
      key,
      value: JSON.stringify(value),
      metadata: JSON.stringify(metadata),
    }
    await prisma.cache.upsert({
      where: {key},
      create: data,
      update: data,
    })
  },
  async delete(key) {
    // we don't care if the key didn't already exist
    await prisma.cache.delete({where: {key}}).catch(() => {})
  },
}
```

SQLite actually supports a JSON field, but prisma does not support this yet.
It's no big deal for me though. This layer allows me to treat the data in the
cache like it's JSON without trouble.

### The double-thick wall

Unfortunately, I hit a bit of a wall once I finished this part of the migration.
MDX pages wouldn't display. Anything that used MDX wouldn't work at all. This
meant not only blog posts or mdx pages, but also any page that has blog post
recommendations (so most pages). It took me quite some time debugging this to
figure out that MDX compilation was causing me trouble because there were
actually two problems and one of them only happened when deployed to my staging
environment ðŸ˜±

The first issue was I happened to be using the same cache key for two functions
ðŸ™ˆ For various reasons I don't want to get into, they actually do end up storing
the same data. The reason this migration to the new `cachified` package broke
this is because the cachified library does a good job of making sure you only
get a fresh value for a particular key once and all other requests for it wait
on that first one. So I ended up getting into a situation where Function A would
trigger getting a fresh value which called Function B which asked for that same
key in the cache so it hung forever.

If that's confusing, it's because it was. Don't worry, it's not important that
you understand the problem. Just know this. When dealing with a cache, make sure
to not share a cache key between two different places that can create the cached
value.

The second issue was extremely frustrating because I couldn't reproduce it
locally. This meant I had to deploy my site to make and view changes. I couldn't
use my preferred debugging tools (I could only use `console.log` and watch the
logs). I made use of [`patch-package`](https://npm.im/patch-package) to add logs
to libraries I was using. I added a crazy number of logs to
`@remix-run/server-runtime` only to determine that it was working perfectly.

I added a resource route to the app so I could run _only_ the offending code (to
reduce logs and just because this is typically a good practice during debugging
to scope down the search area). I eventually found that the issue lay in MDX
compilation again. I added logs to `mdx-bundler` and found that execution
stopped when starting to actually compile the MDX with `esbuild`.

Finally I realized it was a very specific blog post that caused the hold up. It
was my ["Migrating to Jest"](/blog/migrating-to-jest) blog post. I realized I
needed to figure out what part of that post was causing issues. So I updated my
GitHub fetching code so it could fetch from the correct branch (so I could make
content changes in the `dev` branch and not `main` where people would be
confused about my experiments in production). With that in place, I chopped up
the post into 10 sections. Each had a part of the post.

I hit the special resource route for each of those sections. I found it was in
the last section. I further split that into 6 more sections and found the
problem was a specific tweet. The tweet at the end of the post where I said:
"PayPal is hiring!" which also linked to a PayPal job listings page that is no
longer working. My custom twitter embed `remark` plugin performs a GET request
to links within tweets so I can display metadata like the
title/description/image for the page. Unfortunately because the page wasn't
working (it just hangs forever), it caused compilation to hang forever which
caused most pages on my site to hang forever as well.

Phew! What a pain! So I added a timeout for compilation and I removed the tweet
from the post. There's probably more I could do to improve the resilience of
this code as well ðŸ˜…

### Deploying LiteFS

With that bug worked out, my site was humming along just fine in a single
region. So I was ready to figure out how to setup LiteFS to get multi-region
working.

{/* TODO: link this to the stream */}

Because LiteFS is still in beta, documentation is still relatively sparse. Even
worse, somehow I missed all but the example documentation page. So I was
stumbling around in the dark quite a bit. Finally I figured out which files I
needed and where. I got help from Ben directly in a Zoom call during one of my
streams. I did bump into a number of issues that went back as feedback to the
Fly team. Ben was quite responsive and helpful. I finally did get it working
though.

One thing I love about LiteFS is that it doesn't infect my app code all over the
place. The only thing I need to worry about is that read replicas are read-only
(for now), so I have to do the `fly-replay` stuff. Really looking forward to
when I won't have to even do that and it really will just be a bit of
configuration that doesn't impact my app code one bit.

### Cypress to Playwright

{/* TODO: write about caching the SQLite db? */}

While I was at it, I decided to delete the Cypress tests that were failing every
run anyway and swap them for Playwright tests. Cypress is still great, but I do
like Playwright quite a bit and it's nice to have tests that actually run.

### Data migration

Ok, so I actually worked this bit out quite a bit earlier.
